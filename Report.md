# Mandatory assignment 2

## Question 1
What I am going to do is to perform authentication and integrity. I am going to solve the authenticity by using the El Gamal signature scheme. We can do so because Alice and Bob knows each others public key because of the PKI. And in order to solve the integrity then I am going to implement a commitment protocol, such that we know that the message getting in with the assigned key is the actual message that we being sent.

In this way Alice and Bob can see that the message came from who we expected and that they didn't cheat. They actually rolled the dice and committed to that dice roll before sending it.
